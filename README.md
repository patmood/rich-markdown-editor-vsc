# Rich Markdown Editor

Edit markdown files with a rich editor in the style of Outline/Dropbox Paper/Notion etc.

Perfect for writing docs, authoring blog posts, and editing markdown website content.

Also has syntax highlighting for code blocks.

This extension replaces the default code editor for markdown files with a rich version, allowing you to "edit" in preview mode.
